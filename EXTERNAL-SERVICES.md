## Important Notes

1. **User Control**: All external service connections are completely opt-in. Data is never sent to any external service unless you explicitly configure an integration.

2. **API Keys and Credentials**: This plugin stores API keys, OAuth tokens, and credentials in your WordPress database (encrypted where possible). These credentials are used solely to authenticate with the services you choose to integrate.

3. **Data Mapping**: You have complete control over what data is sent to each service through the field mapping interface.

4. **Webhooks**: For webhook-based integrations, data is sent to URLs you provide. You are responsible for ensuring these webhook endpoints are secure and comply with privacy regulations.

5. **Logging**: Integration logs are stored locally in your WordPress database for debugging purposes. You can control log retention in plugin settings.

6. **GDPR and Privacy Compliance**: When using this plugin to send data to external services, you are responsible for:
   - Obtaining appropriate user consent
   - Providing privacy notices to your users
   - Ensuring compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations
   - Reviewing the privacy policies and terms of service for each external service you use

7. **Data Security**: Always use HTTPS for your WordPress site and ensure WordPress, this plugin, and all other plugins are kept up to date.

8. **Third-Party Responsibility**: This plugin acts as a data processor. The third-party services you connect to have their own data processing practices. Please review their respective privacy policies and terms of service.
